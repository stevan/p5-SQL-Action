== PRIMARY KEY REFACTOR

Create Actions need to ask the ->id of the query

If we remove this, then all the locate_id stuff can go away in Query

Perhaps locate_id can be kept, but it would take a primary key as an
argument and then go about finding it if needed.

But locate_id is the builder for &id, which is the problem right now.

The other change is that Query needs to stop taking the driver,
table_name, primary_key thing and just take the Table object maybe.

== TODO:

- Fetch Related that feeds into a Create or Store
    - perhaps this is just a Create::XRef thing

- Add statements
    - Create Table
    - Load Data Infile

- Improve Join syntax
    - much of this can be auto-generated from metadata

- Table's need to understand foreign keys (maybe)
    - this can just be suggestions, not tightly enforced
    - hmm, maybe this relation can be specified in the schema?!?!?!
