== TODO:

- Fetch Related that feeds into a Create or Store
    - perhaps this is just a Create::XRef thing

- Add statements
    - Create Table
    - Load Data Infile

- Improve Join syntax
    - much of this can be auto-generated from metadata

- Table's need to understand foreign keys (maybe)
    - this can just be suggestions, not tightly enforced
    - hmm, maybe this relation can be specified in the schema?!?!?!
